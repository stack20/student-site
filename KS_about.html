    <p>As a presidential candidate, I want to tell you about my life. I was born in Syracuse, NY. I'm a Junior at the George Washington University studying Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics. I'm a member of Kappa Alpha Order, and I work in the Alumni Relations Department at GWSB as a Development Intern. </p>
    <p>I enjoy hobbies like golf, listening to music, playing basketball. I write for The Rival at GW in the Guilty Pleasures section and am looking to work for an online news publication.</p>
    <p>I'm also a Journalism minor and plan on travelling to Ireland this summer.</p>
